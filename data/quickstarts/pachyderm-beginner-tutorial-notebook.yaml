      description: |-
        ### Before experimenting with the notebook, run the following command lines to connect your notebook to Pachyderm
        1. Install Pachyderm’s CLI (`pachchtl`) by running the following command from a top new cell in your notebook: `! curl -o /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v2.0.2/pachctl_2.0.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz && tar -xvf /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz  -C /tmp && cp /tmp/pachctl_2.0.2_linux_amd64/pachctl  /opt/app-root/bin/`.
        2. In another cell, run the following to create a new context for your CLI to connect to your cluster. Before running the command, update “pachyderm-operator-install” in the pachd_address with your project name: `!echo '{"pachd_address":"pachd.pachyderm-operator-install.svc.cluster.local:30650"}' | pachctl config set context pachyderm --overwrite`.
        3. Finally, switch the pachctl context to your newly created context by running: `!pachctl config set active-context pachyderm`.
        4. Verify that your active context is the new context: `!pachctl config get active-context` should return "pachyderm".
